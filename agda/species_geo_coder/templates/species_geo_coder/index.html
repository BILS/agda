<p>SpeciesGeoCoder is an open-source software package written in Python and R,
that utilise the <a href='http://www.gdal.org'>GDAL library</a>
(http://www.gdal.org/) for fast analysis of geoTIFF files, which allows for the
easy and fast coding of species into user-defined operational units. These
units may be of any size and be purely spatial (i.e., polygons) such as
political units (countries, states), conservation areas, realms, biomes,
ecoregions, islands, biodiversity hotspots, and areas of endemism; but they may
also be defined as a combination of several criteria, including altitudinal
ranges. This flexibility allows scoring species into complex categories, such
as those encountered in topographically and ecologically heterogeneous
landscapes. The various outputs of SpeciesGeoCoder include quantitative
biodiversity statistics, global and local distribution maps, and Nexus files
that can be directly used in many phylogeny-based applications for ancestral
state reconstruction, investigations on biome evolution, and diversification
rate analyses. For more information please see <a
